An implementation of bayesian neural networks which I use for research purposes.

The following repositories were partly a basis for this package:

[Javier Antoran - Bayesian Neural Networks](https://github.com/JavierAntoran/Bayesian-Neural-Networks)  
[Kumar Shridhar - PyTorch Bayesian CNN](https://github.com/kumar-shridhar/PyTorch-BayesianCNN)
